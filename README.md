# Humanity-s-Fall-UE4-
Humanity's Fall is my Bachelor's Thesis that I presented in the University of Puerto Rico, Bayamon Campus (and got me graduated!).

Genre: Open World, FPS.

Purpose: The goal of Humanity's Fall was to greatly focus on gameplay mechanics done in C++. 
The mechanics are further expanded using blueprints.
Gameplay Mechanics/Systems include:
- Character Control and Camera
- Inventory Management
- Combat System
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Spawn System
- Networking (Multiplayer)
